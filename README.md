# Daily Planner Application

## Description 

Welcome to the README file for the Daily Planner App. Below, you will find important information about the simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code, technologies used, and instructions on how to run or contribute to the app.

## Installation

To get a local copy of this Application up and running, follow these steps:
Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/tetyanaleleka/daily_planner_app


## Usage 

The Daily Planner App shows:
- the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner;
- timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down;
- color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed;
- allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock;
- save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock;
- persist events between refreshes of a page.
